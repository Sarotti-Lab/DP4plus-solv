# Solvent-DP4plus

This repository contains the tool presented in the publication titled **The Role of Solvent Nature in NMR Structure Elucidation Using Computational Methods: A Comprehensive Theoretical and Experimental Study**, to be published ASAP.

For all work using **Solvent DP4+** please cite the primary publication: 

* To be filled once the paper is accepted. 

### Description
>DP4plus-solv is a Python program designed to estimate the sensitivity of structural assignment to the choice of solvent used for acquiring experimental NMR spectra.


### Installation Requirements

**Solvent DP4+** needs python 3.8 or later to work. The module can be installed by console using:
`pip3 install DP4plus-solv`

>Once installed the python module, the program can be executed by console using: `DP4plus-solv`

>or generate a DP4plus-solv.py shortcut on the desktop, which allows direct execution of the program without the use of a console, using: `DP4plus-solv-exe`
>
To verify the correct operation of the software, it is recommended to run the provided example, which can be downloaded by clicking the `Example` button (Figure 2). This will create a folder named `Example_DP4plus_solvent` on the desktop, containing all the files needed to run the example.
